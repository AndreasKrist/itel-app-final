      "fullContent": "According to The Straits Times (2025, January 6), \"Singapore's cyber frameworks and practices are set to become global gold standards, with cybersecurity leaders scrambling for talent and chief information officers (CIOs) embracing agentic systems.\" This shift highlights the emerging trend of autonomous AI agents in workflows, poised to surpass previous technologies such as generative AI and chatbots. These AI agents will operate independently, collaborating with each other and making real-time decisions without constant human input. For example, AI agents could be deployed to handle complex tasks like negotiating with customers who have overdue bills.\n\nMajor tech firms like Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and SAP are integrating these agents into their software to tackle challenges such as talent shortages, boost productivity, and enhance sales and customer service. However, the full benefits of these systems may only become evident by 2025, as many companies are still in the early stages of adoption.\n\nTo fully leverage autonomous AI agents, companies will need to invest in infrastructure, such as data management systems and integration strategies. Additionally, oversight mechanisms will be necessary to ensure these AI systems are used responsibly and to mitigate any potential impacts on employees and stakeholders. These agents have the potential to revolutionize industries by handling complex, time-consuming tasks like customer service and collections (e.g., negotiating overdue payments). This could free up human workers to focus on higher-value activities, improving efficiency and enhancing customer experiences.\n\nAs AI systems become more autonomous, issues surrounding accountability, transparency, and ethical use will become increasingly important. Strong oversight is needed to ensure that AI agents operate in alignment with corporate values and societal norms, while also managing their impact on employees and other stakeholders.\n\nThe demand for cybersecurity experts is also growing rapidly, as companies increase spending to protect not only their own networks but also those of their suppliers. However, the supply of qualified cybersecurity talent is falling short of this demand. According to the Ministry of Manpower's Shortage Occupation List, three out of 13 job categories in Infocomm Technology are cybersecurity roles, highlighting the need for foreign expertise. The Cyber Security Agency is also conducting a study to define the minimum skill requirements for cybersecurity personnel, which could further reduce the talent pool.\n\nSeveral factors are expected to exacerbate the shortage of cybersecurity talent, including the end of support for Windows 10 (after October 14, 2025) and the passing of the Health Information Bill in 2025. The end of support for Windows 10 will leave users vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the lack of security updates, while the Health Information Bill will require healthcare providers to migrate sensitive data, presenting new security and compliance challenges.\n\nThe clear shortage of cybersecurity talent requires comprehensive, long-term solutions. Key measures include ramping up investment in training and development programs and fostering closer collaboration between industry and educational institutions to ensure curricula are better aligned with the sector's evolving needs.\n\nIn December, Indeed reported a significant surge in generative AI-related job postings, with a 4.6-fold increase over the 12 months leading up to September, compared to the previous year. Singapore led other developed economies—such as Ireland, Spain, Canada, Britain, the US, Germany, Australia, and France—in the number of AI-related job postings.\n\nThe demand for AI skills now extends beyond traditional roles in data analytics, reaching industries such as architecture and medical information. This reflects the growing integration of AI across diverse fields. Callam Pickering, Indeed's economist for the Asia-Pacific, noted that the demand for generative AI skills is outpacing supply, as these skills are still emerging and evolving. He emphasized that businesses that can effectively reskill and upskill their existing workforce will have a competitive advantage in the future job market.\n\nAs Singapore's technology landscape evolves, the growing demand for cybersecurity and AI professionals presents both challenges and opportunities for enterprises. The rise of autonomous AI agents is set to transform workflows by handling complex tasks independently, boosting productivity, and enhancing customer experiences. However, the successful integration of these systems will require significant investment in infrastructure, oversight mechanisms, and ongoing skill development. Simultaneously, the shortage of qualified cybersecurity talent calls for long-term solutions, such as increased training and closer collaboration between industry and educational institutions.\n\nReference:\nThe Straits Times.

      "fullContent": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is widely recognized for its ability to enhance efficiency and drive innovation across various sectors. However, some inherent threats can hinder this potential. AI systems are at risk of cybersecurity issues, including adversarial attacks, where malicious actors intentionally attempt to mislead the AI. These issues can worsen existing weaknesses in business systems, leading to data leaks, breaches, and unfair or harmful outcomes. To fully realize AI's benefits while mitigating these risks, organizations must prioritize its security\n\nTo address security concerns, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) has developed the Guidelines on Securing AI Systems to help system owners protect AI throughout its lifecycle. These guidelines raise awareness of potential threats to AI behaviour and system security, offering principles and best practices for implementing security controls. Additionally, the CSA is working with AI and cybersecurity experts to create a Companion Guide that will provide practical measures and insights from both industry and academia to support the main guidelines.\n\nAdditionally, CSA is holding a public consultation on the Guidelines and the Companion Guide, which will close on September 15, 2024.\n\nThe Guidelines point out the cybersecurity risks related to AI, including both classical threats and Adversarial Machine Learning (ML). These new attacks try to confuse the AI and lead to inaccurate or harmful results.\n\nClassical risks include supply chain attacks, unauthorized access, and disruptions to cloud services, data centre operations or other digital infrastructure (e.g Denial of Service attacks). Adversarial ML risks involve data poisoning, evasion attacks that mislead trained models, and extraction attacks that aim to steal sensitive data or the model itself.\n\nRisk Assessment\n\nThe Guidelines suggest that organisations begin securing AI systems with a risk assessment. This helps identify potential risks and priorities, leading to suitable risk management strategies. They recommend a four-step process for managing risks:\n\nStep 1: Conduct a risk assessment that focuses on the security risks to AI systems.\nStep 2: Prioritise areas to address based on risk level, impact, and available resources.\nStep 3: Identify and take the necessary actions to secure the AI system.\nStep 4: Evaluate any remaining risks and decide whether to mitigate or accept them.\nGuidelines for Securing AI Systems\n\nThese Guidelines apply to all five stages of an AI system's lifecycle. System owners should consider it as essential points to ensure the secure implementation of AI.\n\nStage 1: Planning and Design\n• Increase awareness and understanding of security risks.\n• Perform security risk assessments.\n\nStage 2: Development\n• Ensure the security of the supply chain.\n• Evaluate the security benefits and trade-offs when choosing the right model.\n• Identify, monitor, and safeguard AI-related assets.\n• Protect the AI development environment.\n\nStage 3: Deployment\n• Secure the infrastructure and environment for deploying AI systems.\n• Set up incident management procedures.\n• Ensure the responsible release of AI systems.\n\nStage 4: Operations and Maintenance\n• Monitor the inputs to the AI system.\n• Track the outputs and behavior of the AI system.\n• Implement a secure-by-design approach for updates and ongoing learning.\n• Establish a vulnerability disclosure process.\n\nStage 5: End of Life\n• Ensure the proper disposal of data and models.\n\nThe Cyber Security Agency of Singapore's guidelines provide a structured approach for businesses to enhance their AI security, promoting a proactive stance on potential threats. The ongoing public consultation allows stakeholders to contribute their insights, ensuring diverse perspectives are considered in developing effective security measures. As the field of AI security continues to evolve, businesses must remain vigilant and adapt their strategies to counter emerging threats, highlighting the necessity for continuous improvement in safeguarding AI systems.\n\nBy establishing the Guidelines on Securing AI Systems, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) emphasizes the importance of proactive measures in safeguarding AI technologies. This initiative not only raises awareness of potential vulnerabilities but also encourages system owners to adopt best practices for risk management throughout the AI lifecycle.\n\nSource from news from Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA)."
