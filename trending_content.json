      "fullContent": "Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) has revolutionized the way we communicate, enabling voice calls over the internet and bypassing traditional telephone systems. However, few people know that the development of VoIP is significantly tied to a woman who played a pivotal role in shaping this technology.\n\n\nThe Woman Who Created VoIP\n\nDr. Marian Rogers Croak, an engineer and innovator, is credited with creating VoIP technology. During her career at various tech companies, Dr. Croak conducted groundbreaking research and developed algorithms and protocols that enabled voice data to be transmitted over the internet. Her pioneering work in digital communication and her innovative ideas laid the foundation for VoIP technology, though much of the credit is often attributed to a broader group of engineers and developers.\n\nDr. Croak's contributions to the early development of VoIP have had a lasting impact on the future of communication, making it more accessible and affordable worldwide. Her work paved the way for modern communication platforms like Skype, WhatsApp, and Zoom, which are now integral to both personal and professional life.\n\nVoIP technology has grown to provide several key benefits:\n\n- Cost-Effective Communication: VoIP has significantly reduced the cost of voice calls, particularly for international communication. Users can make calls over the internet for little to no cost.\n- Accessibility and Flexibility: VoIP services are available across a variety of devices, including smartphones, computers, tablets, and even dedicated VoIP phones.\n- Enhanced Features: VoIP services often include added features such as video calls, voicemail-to-email, call forwarding, and integration with other online services.\n- Scalability for Businesses: For businesses, VoIP offers scalability and efficiency. Unlike traditional phone systems, which require costly hardware and physical lines, VoIP can be easily scaled to meet a company's needs, reducing costs and simplifying management.\n- Improved Communication Quality: With advancements in VoIP technology, the quality of calls has greatly improved, with high-definition voice and video calls becoming the standard.\nIn summary, VoIP has had a profound impact on the way we communicate, and the role of pioneers like Dr. Marian Rogers Croak in its creation cannot be overstated. Thanks to VoIP, communication has become more accessible, affordable, and feature-rich than ever before, transforming the way we connect globally."

      "fullContent": "According to The Straits Times (2025, January 6), \"Singapore's cyber frameworks and practices are set to become global gold standards, with cybersecurity leaders scrambling for talent and chief information officers (CIOs) embracing agentic systems.\" This shift highlights the emerging trend of autonomous AI agents in workflows, poised to surpass previous technologies such as generative AI and chatbots. These AI agents will operate independently, collaborating with each other and making real-time decisions without constant human input. For example, AI agents could be deployed to handle complex tasks like negotiating with customers who have overdue bills.\n\nMajor tech firms like Microsoft, Google, Salesforce, and SAP are integrating these agents into their software to tackle challenges such as talent shortages, boost productivity, and enhance sales and customer service. However, the full benefits of these systems may only become evident by 2025, as many companies are still in the early stages of adoption.\n\nTo fully leverage autonomous AI agents, companies will need to invest in infrastructure, such as data management systems and integration strategies. Additionally, oversight mechanisms will be necessary to ensure these AI systems are used responsibly and to mitigate any potential impacts on employees and stakeholders. These agents have the potential to revolutionize industries by handling complex, time-consuming tasks like customer service and collections (e.g., negotiating overdue payments). This could free up human workers to focus on higher-value activities, improving efficiency and enhancing customer experiences.\n\nAs AI systems become more autonomous, issues surrounding accountability, transparency, and ethical use will become increasingly important. Strong oversight is needed to ensure that AI agents operate in alignment with corporate values and societal norms, while also managing their impact on employees and other stakeholders.\n\nThe demand for cybersecurity experts is also growing rapidly, as companies increase spending to protect not only their own networks but also those of their suppliers. However, the supply of qualified cybersecurity talent is falling short of this demand. According to the Ministry of Manpower's Shortage Occupation List, three out of 13 job categories in Infocomm Technology are cybersecurity roles, highlighting the need for foreign expertise. The Cyber Security Agency is also conducting a study to define the minimum skill requirements for cybersecurity personnel, which could further reduce the talent pool.\n\nSeveral factors are expected to exacerbate the shortage of cybersecurity talent, including the end of support for Windows 10 (after October 14, 2025) and the passing of the Health Information Bill in 2025. The end of support for Windows 10 will leave users vulnerable to cyberattacks due to the lack of security updates, while the Health Information Bill will require healthcare providers to migrate sensitive data, presenting new security and compliance challenges.\n\nThe clear shortage of cybersecurity talent requires comprehensive, long-term solutions. Key measures include ramping up investment in training and development programs and fostering closer collaboration between industry and educational institutions to ensure curricula are better aligned with the sector's evolving needs.\n\nIn December, Indeed reported a significant surge in generative AI-related job postings, with a 4.6-fold increase over the 12 months leading up to September, compared to the previous year. Singapore led other developed economies—such as Ireland, Spain, Canada, Britain, the US, Germany, Australia, and France—in the number of AI-related job postings.\n\nThe demand for AI skills now extends beyond traditional roles in data analytics, reaching industries such as architecture and medical information. This reflects the growing integration of AI across diverse fields. Callam Pickering, Indeed's economist for the Asia-Pacific, noted that the demand for generative AI skills is outpacing supply, as these skills are still emerging and evolving. He emphasized that businesses that can effectively reskill and upskill their existing workforce will have a competitive advantage in the future job market.\n\nAs Singapore's technology landscape evolves, the growing demand for cybersecurity and AI professionals presents both challenges and opportunities for enterprises. The rise of autonomous AI agents is set to transform workflows by handling complex tasks independently, boosting productivity, and enhancing customer experiences. However, the successful integration of these systems will require significant investment in infrastructure, oversight mechanisms, and ongoing skill development. Simultaneously, the shortage of qualified cybersecurity talent calls for long-term solutions, such as increased training and closer collaboration between industry and educational institutions.\n\nReference:\nThe Straits Times.
