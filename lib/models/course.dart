      description: '''
The Certified Threat Intelligence Analyst (C|TIA) is a training and credentialing program designed and developed in collaboration with cybersecurity and threat intelligence experts from around the globe to help organizations identify and mitigate business risks by converting unknown internal and external threats into known threats. It is a comprehensive, specialist-level program that teaches a structured approach to building effective threat intelligence.

The program from EC-Council is based on a rigorous Job Task Analysis (JTA) of the roles involved in the field of threat intelligence. It differentiates threat intelligence professionals from other information security professionals. It is a highly interactive, comprehensive, and standards-based intensive 3-day training program that teaches information security professionals how to build professional threat intelligence. C|TIA is a method-driven program that uses a holistic approach, covering concepts from planning the threat intelligence project to building a report and disseminating threat intelligence. These concepts are essential for building effective threat intelligence and, when used properly, can secure organizations from future threats or attacks.

Key Learning Points for C|TIA Professionals:
- Different data analysis types and techniques (Statistical Data Analysis, Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), Structured Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (SACH), etc.)
- Complete threat analysis process which includes threat modeling, fine-tuning, evaluation, runbook, and knowledge base creation.
- Different data analysis, threat modeling, and threat intelligence tools.
- Creating effective threat intelligence reports.
- Threat intelligence dissemination and sharing (Dissemination preferences, intelligence collaboration, sharing rules and models, TI exchange types and architecture, participating in sharing relationships, standards and formats for sharing threat intelligence, etc.)
- Different threat intelligence sharing platforms acts, and regulations for sharing strategic, tactical, operational, and technical intelligence.

The course is designed to help participants boost their productivity by automating repetitive tasks or simplifying complex ones. Learning VBA can save you time and minimize errors when performing repetitive tasks. It also enhances your employability by increasing your productivity, especially if you work in organizations that heavily use Excel, like finance, data analysis, or data warehousing. Another benefit of learning VBA is that it helps you develop logical thinking skills to create more advanced macros. It’s also easy to learn, even without prior programming experience, as you don’t need to master the entire programming language.

This introductory Excel VBA course teaches learners how to navigate the Excel programming environment and understand the basics of working with Objects, Variables, Conditionals, and Loops. You’ll also learn how to troubleshoot errors and make corrections to ensure the program runs correctly.
