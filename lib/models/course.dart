      description: '''
The Certified Threat Intelligence Analyst (C|TIA) is a training and credentialing program designed and developed in collaboration with cybersecurity and threat intelligence experts from around the globe to help organizations identify and mitigate business risks by converting unknown internal and external threats into known threats. It is a comprehensive, specialist-level program that teaches a structured approach to building effective threat intelligence.

The program from EC-Council is based on a rigorous Job Task Analysis (JTA) of the roles involved in the field of threat intelligence. It differentiates threat intelligence professionals from other information security professionals. It is a highly interactive, comprehensive, and standards-based intensive 3-day training program that teaches information security professionals how to build professional threat intelligence. C|TIA is a method-driven program that uses a holistic approach, covering concepts from planning the threat intelligence project to building a report and disseminating threat intelligence. These concepts are essential for building effective threat intelligence and, when used properly, can secure organizations from future threats or attacks.

Key Learning Points for C|TIA Professionals:
- Different data analysis types and techniques (Statistical Data Analysis, Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), Structured Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (SACH), etc.)
- Complete threat analysis process which includes threat modeling, fine-tuning, evaluation, runbook, and knowledge base creation.
- Different data analysis, threat modeling, and threat intelligence tools.
- Creating effective threat intelligence reports.
- Threat intelligence dissemination and sharing (Dissemination preferences, intelligence collaboration, sharing rules and models, TI exchange types and architecture, participating in sharing relationships, standards and formats for sharing threat intelligence, etc.)
- Different threat intelligence sharing platforms acts, and regulations for sharing strategic, tactical, operational, and technical intelligence.

The course is designed to help participants boost their productivity by automating repetitive tasks or simplifying complex ones. Learning VBA can save you time and minimize errors when performing repetitive tasks. It also enhances your employability by increasing your productivity, especially if you work in organizations that heavily use Excel, like finance, data analysis, or data warehousing. Another benefit of learning VBA is that it helps you develop logical thinking skills to create more advanced macros. It’s also easy to learn, even without prior programming experience, as you don’t need to master the entire programming language.

This introductory Excel VBA course teaches learners how to navigate the Excel programming environment and understand the basics of working with Objects, Variables, Conditionals, and Loops. You’ll also learn how to troubleshoot errors and make corrections to ensure the program runs correctly.

C# is one of the most popular development languages in the world. While it was originally possible to build .NET apps running on Windows-based devices only, the game has changed. Dramatically. Using Xamarin, we can now write apps that run on Android and iOS devices natively using C#. This way, C# allows us to target billions of extra devices using the language we all love. The experiences which users get from Xamarin base apps are – fully native.

In this 4-day course, you will learn about the Xamarin environment. You will also learn about cross-platform developments: Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS.

You will also learn to provide seamless experiences and self-service management capabilities for all users. Finally, learn to create adaptive access and governance of your identity and access management solutions ensuring you can troubleshoot, monitor, and report on your environment. The Identity and Access Administrator may be a single individual or a member of a larger team. Learn how this role collaborates with many other roles in the organization to drive strategic identity projects. The end goal is to provide you knowledge to modernize identity solutions, to implement hybrid identity solutions, and to implement identity governance.

The Managing Microsoft Teams course is designed for persons who are aspiring to the Microsoft 365 Teams Admin role. Microsoft Teams admins configure, deploy, and manage Office 365 workloads for Microsoft Teams that focus on efficient and effective collaboration and communication in an enterprise environment.

This course covers six central elements – Microsoft Teams overview, implementing governance, security and compliance for Microsoft Teams, preparing the environment for a Microsoft Teams deployment, deploying and managing teams, managing collaboration and managing communication in Microsoft Teams.

In Microsoft Teams overview, you will get an overview of Microsoft Teams including Teams architecture and related Office 365 workloads. You will be provided an overview of security and compliance in Microsoft Teams and finally get an overview of how to manage Microsoft Teams. In implementing governance, security and compliance for Microsoft Teams, you will plan and configure governance for Office 365 groups including expiration and naming policies. Then you will implement security by configuring conditional access, MFA or Threat Management for Microsoft Teams. Finally, you will implement compliance for Teams by using DLP policies, eDiscovery cases or supervision policies.

In preparing the environment for a Microsoft Teams deployment, you plan an upgrade from Skype for Business to Microsoft Teams by evaluating upgrade paths with coexistence and upgrade modes, manage meeting migrations and configuring coexistence and upgrade settings. Then you plan and configure network settings for Microsoft Teams, and finally you will deploy and manage Microsoft Teams endpoints. In deploying and managing teams, you will learn how to create and manage teams, manage membership and access for both, internal and external users.

In managing collaboration in Microsoft Teams, you will manage chat and collaboration experiences such as team settings or private channel creation policies. Finally, you will manage settings for Teams apps such as app setup policies, Apps, bots & connectors in Microsoft Teams or publish a custom app in Microsoft Teams. This course concludes with managing communication in Microsoft Teams. You will learn how to manage Live event and meetings experiences, manage phone numbers or Phone System for Microsoft Teams and finally how to troubleshoot audio, video, and client issues.

As attackers have learned to evade traditional signature-based solutions such as firewalls, an analytics based approach within the IT security industry is increasingly important for most organizations. The behavioral analytics skills covered by CySA+ identify and combat malware, and advanced persistent threats (APTs), resulting in enhanced threat visibility across a broad attack surface. CompTIA CySA+ is for IT professionals looking to gain the following analyst skills:

- Configure and use threat detection tools
- Perform data analysis
- Interpret the results to identify vulnerabilities, threats and risks to an organization

In this 5-day course, participants use their knowledge and skills required to configure and use threat detection tools, perform data analysis and interpret the results to identify vulnerabilities, threats and risks to an organization, with the end goal of securing and protecting applications and systems within an organization.
